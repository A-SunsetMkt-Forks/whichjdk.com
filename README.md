# Which Version of JDK Should I Use?

There are plenty of Javaâ„¢ Development Kits (JDK) distributions available. 
Pretty much all of them build on the source code of the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net). 
The distributions differ in licences, commercial support, supported platforms and installation packages, and update frequency.

## TL;DR

In most cases, use the latest [Adoptium Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK LTS version](https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) for your platform architecture (which usually is `x64`).
