# Which Version of JDK Should I Use?

There are plenty of Javaâ„¢ Development Kits (JDK) available.
Pretty much all of them build on the source code of the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net).

## TL;DR

In most cases, use the latest [Adoptium OpenJDK LTS version](https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) for your platform architecture (which usually is `x64`).
